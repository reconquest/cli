# unborn cli

The project is under heavy development.

Here we're trying DSL approach for parsing command line arguments because
docopt doesn't support sub command and too much hustle with indentation,
struct-like packages suck even more, can't even write long description for
commands/flags, can't specify default value without hustle.
